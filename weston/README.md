## Original Source

The City Clerk gave me this Sharepoint folder:

https://westonfl.sharepoint.com/sites/CityClerk/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FCityClerk%2FShared%20Documents%2FRecord%20Requests%2FALPR%20Commission%20Action&p=true&ga=1

I have no idea if it will remain live forever, which is why I created this GitHub repo.
